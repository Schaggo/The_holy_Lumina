Reinterpreting the history of, theory, and algorithms used in photogrammetry into a pseudo religous canon. This is the result of boredom, with the help of ChatGPT.

## In the beginning there was light

In the beginning, there was an abundance of light, almost overwhelmingly so. And then a bunch of stuff happend until a curious soul pondered, "What might we achieve with such radiant energy?" 
To which Niépce responded, "Let us harness it." And so they did, upon plates graced with silver nitrate. And they perceived its beauty — albeit imperfect — 
and marveled, for the power of imagery truly was a wonder to behold.

And after the passing of many seasons, another inquisitive spirit declared, "Truly, I am uncertain of that hill's stature. We have its design, yet how might
we confirm its true elevation?" Aimé Laussedat, with wisdom and innovation, proclaimed, "By wielding twin lenses and the art of calculation, behold: Photogrammetry!"
And then, in camaraderie and celebration, all partook in a shared brew. And they exclaimed in unison, "Indeed, it is good!"

## "The Benediction of Clarity"

May thine overlap ever be abundant and thine lenses steadfastly sharp, bearing witness to the world's veracity. When an image strayeth from perfection, be swift in discernment and hasten to remove it,
lest thou be burdened in the chambers of Lightroom later. Let the pixels come together with utmost precision, for every measure and every insight is a testament to truth. As thou sendest forth drones 
to the heavens, may the skies be cloaked in soft overcast, diminishing sharp shadows and bestowing upon thee a canvas of consistent light. In thy sacred quest to chart and decipher the land, may 
adversities be few and enlightenments manifold. 
Guided by the ancient wisdom of Daguerre, Laussedat, and the elders of the craft, partake in the blessings and continue to illuminate the obscured. Through thine eye, may all creation be truly seen.

## Chapter IV: The Digital Dawn and the Adversary's Veil

In the early epochs, when light danced solely upon the realm of film and plates, there arose whispers among the wise. These whispers told of a world where images would be sealed not upon the canvas of film, but within the ethereal chambers of numbers and codes.

</details> emerged a prophet in the house of Kodak, named Steven Sasson. With the ancient wisdom passed down through his forefathers and divine inspiration, he conceived the Firstborn of Digital Cameras. Unlike its predecessors, this apparatus captured light not on film, but with an electronic sentinel, translating luminance into digital scripture.

Yet, the path to sharing this revelation with the tribes of the Earth was not straight nor clear. The Firstborn Digital, though a marvel, was in its infancy. The images it bore were yet to match the splendor of film. The tablets upon which these scriptures were written were limited, and the sanctuaries where they could be shared or revered were few.

But beyond these worldly challenges lurked a more sinister shadow, an adversary known by many as Obscurant. This spirit, the embodiment of stagnation and the terror of the new, whispered darkly into the councils of Kodak. "The age is not ripe," he breathed, "Cling to the known tapestries of film, let not this digital phantom unsettle thine ancient ways."

For a season, under the sway of Obscurant, the digital prophecy was obscured. While the house of Kodak tarried, other seers and tribes, undeterred by the adversary's whispers, began to mold and spread what Prophet Sasson had heralded.

Yet, as with all truths written in the stars, the ascendancy of the digital illumination could not be bound in shadow forever. The era of digital enlightenment was preordained, and though delayed, its brilliance broke forth, casting away both the tangible chains and the intangible veils that sought to hinder it.

And lo, this chapter stands as a testament to the undying spirit of revelation, ever prevailing against both the trials of the world and the shadows of doubt and delay.
