Reinterpreting the history of, theory, and algorithms used in photogrammetry into a pseudo religous canon. This is the result of boredom, with the help of ChatGPT.

## In the beginning there was light

In the beginning, there was an abundance of light, almost overwhelmingly so. And then a bunch of stuff happend until a curious soul pondered, "What might we achieve with such radiant energy?" 
To which Niépce responded, "Let us harness it." And so they did, upon plates graced with silver nitrate. And they perceived its beauty — albeit imperfect — 
and marveled, for the power of imagery truly was a wonder to behold.

And after the passing of many seasons, another inquisitive spirit declared, "Truly, I am uncertain of that hill's stature. We have its design, yet how might
we confirm its true elevation?" Aimé Laussedat, with wisdom and innovation, proclaimed, "By wielding twin lenses and the art of calculation, behold: Photogrammetry!"
And then, in camaraderie and celebration, all partook in a shared brew. And they exclaimed in unison, "Indeed, it is good!"

## "The Benediction of Clarity"

May thine overlap ever be abundant and thine lenses steadfastly sharp, bearing witness to the world's veracity. When an image strayeth from perfection, be swift in discernment and hasten to remove it,
lest thou be burdened in the chambers of Lightroom later. Let the pixels come together with utmost precision, for every measure and every insight is a testament to truth. As thou sendest forth drones 
to the heavens, may the skies be cloaked in soft overcast, diminishing sharp shadows and bestowing upon thee a canvas of consistent light. In thy sacred quest to chart and decipher the land, may 
adversities be few and enlightenments manifold. 
Guided by the ancient wisdom of Daguerre, Laussedat, and the elders of the craft, partake in the blessings and continue to illuminate the obscured. Through thine eye, may all creation be truly seen.
